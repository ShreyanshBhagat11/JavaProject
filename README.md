    Abstract about our Project

    -> We have made this project called Secrete Code Generator to solve problem of user which forgets their Important password,information etc So in order to retrieve them they have to save it in their computer but the problem is they can only save it as a simple text and anyone can see and retrieve their personal data.
    -> So our application solve this problem, and it can encrypt user password,message any useful data. So when user uses our application and encrypt data a then user can save it anywhere knowing the fact that now even if someone can see data but he/she would just see a jumble words and obviously this jumble words is not a password at all.
    -> When the legit user wants his/her password or data he/she can simply uses our application to decrypt data and now he can use to login into data with decrypt password.
    -> For some user it is tedious task to set a strong password so we have one more feature in our project that can generate a strong random password with the help of All special character,small letters , capital letters and numbers.
